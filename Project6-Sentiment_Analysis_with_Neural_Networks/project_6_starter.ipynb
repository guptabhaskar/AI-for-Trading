    "## Introduction\n",
    "When deciding the value of a company, it's important to follow the news. For example, a product recall or natural disaster in a company's product chain. You want to be able to turn this information into a signal. Currently, the best tool for the job is a Neural Network. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you'll use posts from the social media site [StockTwits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StockTwits). The community on StockTwits is full of investors, traders, and entrepreneurs. Each message posted is called a Twit. This is similar to Twitter's version of a post, called a Tweet. You'll build a model around these twits that generate a sentiment score.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've collected a bunch of twits, then hand labeled the sentiment of each. To capture the degree of sentiment, we'll use a five-point scale: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, very positive. Each twit is labeled -2 to 2 in steps of 1, from very negative to very positive respectively. You'll build a sentiment analysis model that will learn to assign sentiment to twits on its own, using this labeled data.\n",
